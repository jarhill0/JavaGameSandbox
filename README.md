# JavaGameSandbox

I'm just messing around with building a "game" in Java.

Currently I have built a working prototype.

## Todo:

- ~~Prevent the character from leaving the bounds of the game window~~
- ~~Add more realistic acceleration, rather than forcing the character to max velocity immediately.~~
- ~~Add a max velocity~~
- ~~Wall collisions should set that component of velocity to 0.~~
- ~~Add friction?~~
- Add player collision
- ~~Highlight location of collision~~
