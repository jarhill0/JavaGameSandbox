# JavaGameSandbox

I'm just messing around with building a "game" in Java.

Currently I have built a working prototype. All you can do is move a sprite around using the arrow keys (and the game will move at a constant rate while the arrowkey is held down, rather than waiting for keydown events).

## Todo:

- ~~Prevent the character from leaving the bounds of the game window~~
- ~~Add more realistic acceleration, rather than forcing the character to max velocity immediately.~~
- ~~Add a max velocity~~
- ~~Wall collisions should set that component of velocity to 0.~~
- ~~Add friction?~~
- ~~Add player collision~~
